The setup in docker-compose.yml is pretty straightforward. You can also refer to the author's github page https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns for reference. I have encountered no issue running this app.

```
  cloudflare-ddns:
    container_name: cloudflare-ddns
    image: favonia/cloudflare-ddns:latest
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
    user: 1000:1001 #mengc:docker
